# API and AI Documentation Samples

The repository hosts primarily various API and AI documentation samples.

### 1. Python documentation

This is sample documentation for "Finding a Needle in a Haystack" algorithm written in the Python programming language. Documentation is written in Markdown.

- [findNeedles.md](findNeedles.md)

### 2. Web API documentation

This API documentation is for a web-based product — SoundCloud — an audio streaming service.

- [SoundCloud API.pdf](https://github.com/Faridacoding/API-and-AI-Documentation-Samples/blob/main/SoundCloud%20API.pdf)

### 3. Audio restoration tutorial for datasets to train ML models

This is a machine learning tutorial on cleaning audio datasets for use in ML models. It is a personal, self-taught ML project developed in Google Colab using Python; the documentation was created after development.

- [Noise Cleaning for Audio Datasets v2.pdf](https://github.com/Faridacoding/API-and-AI-Documentation-Samples/blob/main/Noise%20Cleaning%20for%20Audio%20Datasets%20v3.pdf) 

### 4. Gen AI API product documentation

This is a sample API documentation for a Gen AI product &mdash;Kadinsky 2.2&mdash; image generator. It takes the text input and generates an image based on the provided text input. 

- [Kandinsky-2.2 AI image generator API reference documentation.pdf](https://github.com/Faridacoding/API-and-AI-Documentation-Samples/blob/main/Kandinsky-2.2%20AI%20image%20generator%20API%20reference%20documentation.pdf)

### 5. Blog writing for a Deep Learning ML model

This is a blog article for a Deep Learning model to increase the resolution of drone captured images with Super-Resolution methods of Bi-cubic and Bi-linear interpolation.
